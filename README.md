This is a app where the user can look at current events that go around the area they live in. The one major difference from this app is that all these event are strictly in person. Ever since Covid of 2020, people have been more secluded and more distance than ever before because of the lockdown and social distancing. 

As a developer that works from home, I wanted to create an app to help users not only help them be more social but also to a state of mind. The User can search a specific type of event, a crowd size, and a ticket price(if used). The user can also create certain events to their liking to meet people as well.
